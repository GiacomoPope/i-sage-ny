# I-Sage-ny Days

Small repo which contains some notes and resources to aid newcomers to sagemath for I-sage-ny days. 

## Jupyter Notebooks

- **General Tips**: Some useful tips and tricks which came to mind while I was writing everything else
- **Elliptic Curves**: Intended to be the first proper chunk of reading / experimentation for attendees. Includes discussion of how to instantiate fields and rings as well as covering some basics of elliptic curves and Sage functionality.

## Exercises

Currently writing some basic exercises on Typst as an excuse to try it out. Seems like something between markdown and Latex. Pretty simple to use.
