# I-Sage-ny Days

This small repo contains some notes and resources to aid newcomers to SageMath for I-sage-ny days. 

## Jupyter Notebooks

- **General Tips**: Some useful tips and tricks which are more about using Sage than doing mathematics with Sage
- **Elliptic Curves**: Intended to be the first proper chunk of reading / experimentation for attendees. Includes discussion of how to instantiate fields and rings as well as covering some basics of elliptic curves and Sage functionality.
- **Isogenies**: Building from the elliptic curve file, this gives an overview of how to compute isogenies and related functions using SageMath. This file compliments the first of the examples below. 
- **Hyperelliptic Curves**: A small file with some basic functionality of hyperelliptic curves. The lack of depth in this file should motivate everyone to make some additions during this week!

## Examples

During the first day of the event, two examples were given. The notebooks used in these examples are:

- Example One: Two isogenies between elliptic curves
- Example Two: Quaternion Algebras

## Exercises

There are some extended exercises included below which can be used to practice the tips and tricks learnt within these notebooks.
